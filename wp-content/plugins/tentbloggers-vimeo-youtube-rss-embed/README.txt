== Description ==

Adds a video embed shortcode that can be intelligently interpreted by your community's RSS Feed Readers with graceful fall-back link to post.

If you use any video in your blog posts this is a must have plugin! RSS readers are notorious for not interpreting and/or reading when your blog post has a video embedded in it. What happens is that your reader sees a big blank spot in the post or doesn't even see a video to begin with!

Don't lose those valuable readers (and video viewers) ever again! With this plugin it'll not only insert a video shortcode that automatically adjusts it's width/height to your WordPress settings but also creates an elegant fall-back solution within the RSS feed itself.

Here is what it does specifically:

 - Quickly lets you add videos to your blog posts with a click of a button.

 - No setup necessary - works right out of the box! Install and go!

 - Embeds shortcode into your post with your video settings! No need to mess with width or height!

 - Intelligently manages video embeds in your visitors RSS feed readers.

 - Creates graceful fall-back notifying your readers that there is a video in this post with a link back to the direct post for easy viewing!
