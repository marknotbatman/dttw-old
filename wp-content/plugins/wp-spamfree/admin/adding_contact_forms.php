<h2>Adding a Contact Form to Your Blog</h2>

<div class="content">
  <p>First create a page (not post) where you want to have your contact form. Then, insert the following tag (using the HTML editing tab, NOT the Visual editor) and you're done: 
    <code>&lt;!--spamfree-contact--&gt;</code>
    <br />&nbsp;
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>There is no need to configure the form. It allows you to simply drop it into the page you want to install it on. However, there are a few basic configuration options. You can choose whether or not to include Phone and Website fields, whether they should be required, add a drop down menu with up to 10 options, set the width and height of the Message box, set the minimum message length, set the form recipient, enter a custom message to be displayed upon successful contact form submission, and choose whether or not to include user technical data in the email.</p>

  <p>If you want to modify the style of the form using CSS, all the form elements have an ID attribute you can reference in your stylesheet.</p>

    <strong>What the Contact Form feature IS:</strong> A simple drop-in contact form that won't get spammed.<br />
    <strong>What the Contact Form feature is NOT:</strong> A configurable and full-featured plugin like some other contact form plugins out there.<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> Please do not request new features for the contact form, as the main focus of the plugin is spam protection. Thank you.
