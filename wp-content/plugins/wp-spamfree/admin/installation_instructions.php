    <li>After downloading, unzip file and upload the enclosed 'wp-spamfree' directory to your WordPress plugins directory: '/wp-content/plugins/'.<br />&nbsp;</li>
    <li>As always, <strong>activate</strong> the plugin on your WordPress plugins page.<br />&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Check to make sure the plugin is installed properly. Many support requests for this plugin originate from improper installation and can be easily prevented. To check proper installation status, go to the WP-SpamFree page in your Admin. It's a submenu link on the Plugins page. Go the the 'Installation Status' area near the top and it will tell you if the plugin is installed correctly. If it tells you that the plugin is not installed correctly, please double-check what directory you have installed WP-SpamFree in, delete any WP-SpamFree files you have uploaded to your server, re-read the Installation Instructions, and start the Installation process over from step 1. If it is installed correctly, then move on to the next step.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Currently your plugin is: <?php echo "<span style='color:".$wp_installation_status_color.";'>".$wp_installation_status_msg_main."</span>"; ?></strong><br />&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Select desired configuration options. Due to popular request, I've added the option to block trackbacks and pingbacks if the user feels they are excessive. I'd recommend not doing this, but the choice is yours.<br />&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If you are using front-end anti-spam plugins (CAPTCHA's, challenge questions, etc), be sure they are disabled since there's no longer a need for them, and these could likely conflict. (Back-end anti-spam plugins like Akismet are fine, although unnecessary.)</li>
